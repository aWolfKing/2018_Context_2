    feedbackOnBronze: You literally bought the bare minimum to stay alive... Well,
      you did stay alive, so I suppose you did complete this objective...
    feedbackOnSilver: Shitty toilet and a decent bed or rather just a matress and
      a toilet you don't have to be afraid of? a Question you did know how to answer!
      Whichever your priority, we learned where you propably spend the most time.
    feedbackOnGold: 'In order to prevent having nightmares about your toilet you need
      two things: a not so scary toilet and a comftable bed. You will not be having
      nightmares about toilets anymore!'
  - objectiveDescription: Nobody bought you a cactus in response to hearing you are
      going to live on your own. Maybe you should buy one yourself?

    feedbackOnBronze: Even when you live alone, you still need a friend... A small
      cactus friend that is!
    feedbackOnSilver: '"a Small cactus simply isn''t eneugh green" is what you thought
      when you bought this beautiful big cactus.'
    feedbackOnGold: You as a cactus-fanatic cannot simply live without at least 2
      cacti, so youmight have just saved yourself even if it cost you some money you
      might have wanted to spend on somthing else.
