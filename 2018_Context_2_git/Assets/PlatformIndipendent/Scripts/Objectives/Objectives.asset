    feedbackOnBronze: Even when you live alone, you still need a friend... A small
      cactus friend that is!
    feedbackOnSilver: '"a Small cactus simply isn''t eneugh green" is what you thought
      when you bought this beautiful big cactus.'
    feedbackOnGold: You as a cactus-fanatic cannot simply live without at least 2
      cacti, so youmight have just saved yourself even if it cost you some money you
      might have wanted to spend on somthing else.
