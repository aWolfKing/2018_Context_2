      and buy a toilet.

    feedbackOnBronze: You literally bought the bare minimum to stay alive... Well,
      you did stay alive, so I suppose you did complete this objective...
    feedbackOnSilver: Shitty toilet and a decent bed or rather just a matress and
      a toilet you don't have to be afraid of? a Question you did know how to answer!
      Whichever your priority, we learned where you propably spend the most time.
    feedbackOnGold: 'In order to prevent having nightmares about your toilet you need
      two things: a not so scary toilet and a comftable bed. You will not be having
      nightmares about toilets anymore!'
  - objectiveDescription: Nobody bought you a cactus in response to hearing you are
      going to live on your own. Maybe you should buy one yourself?

    feedbackOnBronze: Even when you live alone, you still need a friend... A small
      cactus friend that is!
    feedbackOnSilver: '"a Small cactus simply isn''t eneugh green" is what you thought
      when you bought this beautiful big cactus.'
    feedbackOnGold: You as a cactus-fanatic cannot simply live without at least 2
      cacti, so you might have just saved yourself even if it cost you some money
      you might have wanted to spend on somthing else.
  - objectiveDescription: Winter is coming... Make your house winter ready. (fix your
      windows)

    feedbackOnBronze: 
    feedbackOnSilver: Because tech-support would not help you, you decided to fix
      your windows yourself and you are getting better at it!
    feedbackOnGold: 
  - objectiveDescription: You have eaten more chinese takeaway than you can handle,
      maybe it is time to buy a fridge.
    seasons: 00000000010000000200000003000000

    feedbackOnBronze: You decided that you fridge should function more like a cabin
      than a actual fridge. Spoiled food is still food in a way I guess...
    feedbackOnSilver: You wanted a place to store a lot of food, even if you could
      save energy by buying a smaller fridge.
    feedbackOnGold: Your food never survives longer than a day or two, so why would
      you need a big and energy-feasting fridge?
  - objectiveDescription: '"Should I buy a washingmachine or buy new clothing?", somthing
      you seriously considered for a couple of seconds.'

    feedbackOnBronze: That thing the seller called a washing machine does seem to
      help reduce the amount of dirty clothes on the floor. However, we still are
      not certain wether all clothes actually return...
    feedbackOnSilver: The washing mashine seems to do a great job! Sush a great job
      that you almost forgot that you should also clean yourself every now and then...
    feedbackOnGold: a Washing machine didn't seem eneugh, so you bought a nice shower.
      "Best decision ever!"
